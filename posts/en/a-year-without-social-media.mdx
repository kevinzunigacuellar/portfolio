I decided to leave social media around December 2020 after watching a Netflix documentary "The Social Dilemma". This documentary talks about how social media affects people’s emotional state at the subconscious level. At the time, I thought it was a very cool documentary; it was very interesting to learn about all of the things that impact the human brain. After I watched the show I was left with one question. Is it true that social media is affecting my behavior? This question followed me everywhere, anytime I picked up my phone or anytime I saw other people picking up their phones. This question led to another question: how much of my life have I invested in social media? To answer this question, I went through my phone settings to check my usage time for all social media platforms including Facebook, Instagram, Reddit, Twitter.

On average, I spend about an hour a day on social media. I was surprised because I did not feel that I checked my social media that often. I am not an ‘influencer’ and I don’t follow a lot of influencers. My use of social media boils down to answering the question: what are my friends up to? Or what’s happening around me?

Then I thought; if I had one extra hour what could I do with that time? I always complain that I am a very busy person with school and work and that I do not have the time to do things I want. I have always wanted to learn how to code. I knew the basics but I wanted to know more and create complex and cool projects. I decided to give it a shot. I did not realize how hard it would be given the fact that I was so used to checking my phone all the time.

On my first day, I was doing alright. I was focused on just not opening any social media apps. I turned off notifications (not that I have many of them a day), and I was very happy that I could do it for at least one day.

In the first week, I realized that I was very used to social media to fill in the blanks in my life. For example, if I went for lunch and I was waiting for food I would check my Instagram. Now, I don't know how to fill those blanks. Also, sometimes I forget my goal and open Instagram, and immediately, I remember that I am not supposed to use it. For this reason after the first week, I decided to get rid of the apps so I do not make the same mistake again.

In my first month, I realized that the days went by slowly. There was a lot of time throughout the day, not necessarily a long time, but long enough to read a book or pause to enjoy life. At the end of the month, I decided to start my coding journey by watching coding tutorials and reading books.

After three months, my coding skills were improving. I love the fact that finally, I have fulfilled a promise that I made to myself. My friends noticed that I was not on social media anymore so they figured out a different way to reach me. The number of people I was texting considerably decreased but I got to keep in touch with the ones that actually wanted to talk to me.

I decided to apply for a software engineering internship position at Amazon. I was very happy that they reached out. I had a lot of fun doing the coding assessments and was happy with the overall process but in the end, I did not get the internship. Even though my projects and overall skills were good I had no idea about software from a theoretical level (data structures and algorithms) so I failed to pass my last interview round.

Ten months in. I feel good about leaving social media. At this point in time, I don’t miss it and I do not judge people that use it. When people ask me how I got this far, I tell them the truth “just one day at a time”. I tell them it is not that hard after the first month. I get to enjoy my time working on different projects and meeting new people IRL. When someone wants to show me a nice picture that they posted, they show me the picture in person and they get to see my actual facial expression when I first look at it.

My coding skills have improved a lot. I sometimes teach my friends how to code or help them resolve code issues. I love the fact that I am at the level that I have a very solid grasp of the basics and I am able to write and most importantly understand other software engineering code. I do not focus anymore on how to do create code but on how to improve its’ function.

Would I ever go back to social media? I don’t think that I would go back to social media anytime soon. I am not certain about the future. I do miss some social media features like finding new people through follow recommendations or seeing old pictures, but I am pretty happy to have more time to do things I enjoy.
